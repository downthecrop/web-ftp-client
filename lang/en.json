  "about.modal": "Hi, it's Brain Foo Long. What me really inspired to make this project was, i bought a synology NAS and quickly realized that there is no comfortable way to download files from a FTP server directly to my NAS. There are some half-made GUI tools and hardcore command line apps but nothing of that is what i've searched for. Long story short, the result is this application. Hope you like it, hope it's usefull for you. Have a nice day.",
